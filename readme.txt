    There are two screens in the design, first should be the credentials one and second one will be valuation one.

    Design is for mobile only, you can do it for desktop too if you want.

    A person visiting the URL, first will fill up his credentials

    In the valuation process, we have two set of coins, 

        NET COINS = Highest Valuer Coins

        GROSS COINS = Sum of all the individual net coins value. 

    If the user clicks on the LEAD + 100 button, then that particular user will be now the highest valuer i.e. the lead user and this process goes on and that needs to get updated below the post where terry_dias is mentioned and accordingly, the lead coins should also get updated.

    Gross coins will now be Old Gross coins + New Net Coins. In the given link, we have gross coins as 2100 and the net coins as 1100. So upon tapping on the LEAD + 100 = Net Coins + 100 = 1200 and Gross Coins = 2100 + 1200 = 3300.   

    144 hours timer should get started upon the live of the website ( countdown timer ). Any user will not be able to do the valuation process after 144 hours.

    Every valuation ( the process we have mentioned above ) should get stored to the database as name, username, net coins, gross coins.

    Data should get stored to the database which can be easily accessed.
